# The purpose of the system. i.e., the problem you would like to solve:
	
We want to create a forum for discussing the problem what they facing and let every TKU’s students easily ask questions and find answers.Tamkang university students can create an account and feel free to discuss anything’s about college.The forum contains a lot of categories which can let members easily post or find the relevant information.



# The functionality of the system. You may consider using some detailed scenarios to describe the functions and flows of the system:

We will create a forum about our college and because if we don't classified articles what user post, it will be difficult when they're finding, so we gonna setup many topics for user to post their articles then it will be more clear for someone who wants to find information. Second, rules in school are keep changing, there are many new rules or some rules would be canceled so we have to browse our forum usually and delete articles which show us wrong information. Everyone can post their idea if they create and account with their ID number, it will be a free forum, we can speak or publish whatever we want. 



# The minimal viable demonstration system that can be done within 5 or 6 weeks. (The subset of the functions described in section 2):
	
We will design a registration and login function to facilitate the identification of the identity and whether the member is a student or not. Use simple classification of articles and decide whether the articles will be delete or not nt release time or popularity of the article. Each member has their own main page , you can see articles that have been published or your favorite articles, you can also enter a profile to let others know your friends.
